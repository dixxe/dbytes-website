# D-bytes
D-bytes is a website for my team which used as headquarters.
This project is open source and it's always will be that way.

## Can I use this website?
Yes you can! But you must follow MIT license if you doing so. 

To start website you need to:
- Create .env file and populate it with LOGIN, PASSWORD for admin panel.
- Create blogs.db database and populate it with `initdb()` method.

## ToDo
- [x] Comments and code refactoring
- [ ] Comments and likes for blog 
- [ ] Team assets (todo list, members, joining form)
- [ ] Better frontend
